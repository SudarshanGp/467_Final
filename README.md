Our team collected our food data over two weeks by using MyFitnessPal and recording the cost. This data was then visualized in two ways seen under View Food Trends and Explore Food Data.


**View Food Trends:**


On this page you can view a Radar Graph where each colored shape represents a person. The gray background circle represents the ideal percentages for all nutritional values. Ideally, everyone would be a full circle but most people do not get the required percentage of all nutritional values, which is seen on this graph. Since everyone's information is overlaid, the user can directly compare two or more users to see who is the healthiest.


**Explore Food Data:**


This page uses a Parallel Coordinate Line Graph to compare the nutritional values of various food items with their cost. The graph can be filtered by selecting a range for any of the nutritional values or cost. Below the graph is a table that displays the information of each line on the graph at a given time. The user can filter the graph to find interesting trends such as the higher protein content in expensive food items.

**Additional Features:**
The radar graph can be filtered by meal types. For a given nutrient, the graph showcases the intake as a percentage of its recommended value (according to the World Health Organization). We use the following study "[Modeling Expert Opinions on Food Healthiness: A Nutrition Metric]" to determine the healthiest food eaten by a person.
